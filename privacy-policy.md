Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how our app, "Mesajlar," uses and protects your personal information. By using our app, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use

Our app requires SMS permissions to function properly as a default SMS application. These permissions enable "Mesajlar" to send and receive SMS messages, access message content and contact numbers, and analyze incoming messages to identify potential spam messages.

When a spam message is identified, users have the option to report it by clicking on the spam button located in the top right corner of the message screen. The message is then moved to a separate spam folder within the app.

We do not collect or store any other personal information, such as your name, email address, or location.

We may use the information we collect to:

Provide SMS functionality to our users
Improve our app's features and functionality
Respond to user inquiries and support requests
Comply with legal requirements
Cookies

"Mesajlar" does not use cookies or any other tracking technologies.

Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, theft, or loss. However, no security measures can provide absolute protection, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and we encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of "Mesajlar" after we post any modifications to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the app's permissions, please contact us at sherlockhakan72@gmail.com

I hope this updated privacy policy is helpful to you. However, please note that this is just an example and you should create a privacy policy that is tailored to the features of your app and complies with legal requirements.
